# Traffic-Sign-Classifcation-using-CNN-and-Vision-Transformer
## Project Name: 
Traffic Sign Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Description:

- This project implements a CNN model to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. The model achieves an accuracy of 97% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing various traffic signs.
- implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for classifying traffic signs from a dataset
